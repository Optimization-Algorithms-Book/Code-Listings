> [!TIP]
> Here you can find the complete solutions to the coding exercises presented in Appendix C of the book. Before checking the solutions, I encourage you to attempt the coding exercises on your own. This will help you strengthen your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of the concepts. 
> Make sure to install the necessary libraries by uncommenting the `pip` command included at the beginning of each cell.
