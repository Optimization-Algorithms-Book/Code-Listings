> [!TIP]
> * You can either set up a Python environment on your machine by installing the required libraries or run all examples online using Google Colab, a free platform that provides a ready-to-use Python environment in your browser.
> * Make sure to install the necessary libraries by uncommenting the `pip` command included at the beginning of each cell.
