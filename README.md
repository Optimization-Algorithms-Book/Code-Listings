# Optimization Algorithms: AI techniques for design, planning, and control problems

This book is written for practitioners interested in solving ill-structured search and optimization problems using modern derivative-free algorithms. It will get you up to speed with the core concepts of search and optimization and endow you with the ability to handle practical design, planning and control problems.

Without assuming any prior knowledge of search and optimization, and with only an intermediate knowledge of data structures and Python, this book is designed to take anyone from never having solved search and optimization problems to being a well-rounded practitioner. You will be able to select, implement, and adapt the right solver for the right problem.
